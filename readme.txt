== Description ==
It's time to stop logging into eNom seperately, and start managing it from WordPress. 

You HAVE to submit your IP to eNom to activate the reseller API ability (we can't do that for you). If you have that done, then activate, and start using the features on the back-end or front-end of Wordpress. 

** Coming Soon **

* Namespinner (widget)
* Domain Management (including TLD offerings, retrieval, and pricing)
* Purchasing domain names (advance)
* WhoIs (page and widget)
* SSL: selling, managing
* TrustE: selling, managing
* goMobi: selling, managing
* Business listing: selling, managing
* DNS Hosting: selling, managing

And many, many, many more features.

Also coming soon: 

* HobiDay - for GoDaddy users 
* HobiCheap - for NameCheap users
* HobiNam - for Name.com users
* HobiSRS - for OpenSRS.com users
* HobiReg - for Register.com users
