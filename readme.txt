*   Search domains (backend and widget for clients to use)
*   List Domains
*   Host record viewing
*   Demo mode for you to move between the live and test eNom API
*   View/manage account settings

** Coming Soon **

*   Domain Management (including TLD offerings, retrieval, and pricing)
*   Purchasing domain names (advance)
*   WhoIs (page and widget)
*   VARS-related 

And many, many more features.
